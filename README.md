## PrivaSwap
PrivaSwap allows the bitcoin users to transition into Ethereum by not hindering their privacy.

Users can swap their Bitcoins to tBTC tokens on Ethereum powered by Keep Network. These tokens are then transferred to a totally new Stealth Address via Umbra Protocol maintaining the Privacy of the User.

###Benefit of using Umbra Protocol with tBTC
Umbra offers a ton of benefits as compared to Tornado Cash:

* Valid for any arbitrary amount of Tokens (Not dependent on Slot Sizes)
* No Waiting time as instant and direct transfer
* Less Gas Fee per transaction as just simple transfers.
* DIRECT tBTC transfers (No need to convert to other supported tokens by tornado cash)
